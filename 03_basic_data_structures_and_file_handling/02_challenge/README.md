Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple hand game that is often used as a decision-making tool between two people. The game has three possible outcomes for each pair of choices: rock, paper, and scissors.

Here are the basic rules of the game:

- **Rock crushes Scissors**: Rock wins against scissors because a rock can break or crush scissors.
- **Scissors cuts Paper**: Scissors wins against paper because scissors can cut through paper.
- **Paper covers Rock**: Paper wins against rock because paper can cover or wrap around rock.

Write a program in `main.py` that simulates the rock paper scissors game between two players â€” the computer and yourself.

You should use the `random` module to produce random numbers that can be used in the computer decision.
