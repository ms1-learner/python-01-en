# Demonstrate how to:
# -------------------
# 1) Assign the integer value 3 to a variable `first_int`. Cast `first_int` to a float, and store the result in a variable named `converted_int`.
# 2) Assign the float value 3 to a variable `first_float`. Cast `first_float` to an int, and store the result in a variable named `converted_float`.
# 3) Perform division using the results from 1) and 2), and store the result in a variable named `quotient`.
# 4) Perform multiplication using the results from 1) and 2), and store the result in a variable named `product`.
#
# What information is lost during which conversions?
